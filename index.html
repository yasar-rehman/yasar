		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
		I received my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from City University of Hong Kong, in 2019. During my Ph.D. study, I worked under the supervision Dr. Lai-Man Po on Face Liveness detection using Deep Learning techniques. Prior to my Ph.D. degree, I worked in NuSyS Lab under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Tariq on Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks  (WMSN).
		I am currently working with  TCL Corporate Research (Hong Kong) co., Limited  as an Algorithm Specialist.
