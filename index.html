			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p> I received my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from City University of Hong Kong, in 2019. 
				During my Ph.D. study, I worked under the supervision Dr. Lai-Man Po on Face Liveness detection using Deep Learning techniques. 
				Prior to my Ph.D. degree, I worked in NuSyS Lab under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Tariq on Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks  (WMSN).
				I am currently working with  TCL Corporate Research (Hong Kong) co., Limited  as an Algorithm Specialist.
			</p> 
			<h1>Research Interests</h1>
			<p>
			Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Face Anti-spoofing, Video Summarization, Computational Photography <br> <br>
			Energy Aware Object Tracking and Localization in WMSN <br>
