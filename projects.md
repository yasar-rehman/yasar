Face anti-spoofing, also known as Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), deal with the detection of face spoofing attacks made on the face 
biometric-based recognition and authentication system. Face, nowadays, is one of the most easily accessible biometric modality. As a result,
a diverse range of Presentation Attacks (PA) can be produced from a just a single face image. These PA vary from single photographic face image to
sophisticated 3D mask based PA respectively. The current face recognition based authentication systems-without anti-spoofing capabilities-
are vulnerable to face PA. In this project, we attempted to develop deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for face PAD. 
The proposed models include the design of randomization
technique for training deep models on small face anti-spoofing datasets, the design of fusion layer for merging the neural network generated images 
and real world images, the design of stereo-imaging technique for face PAD, and the design of perturbation layer for inducing the information of
hand-crafted features in the deep feature maps.

Energy efficient object tracking and image transmission are one of the key issues in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN). 
Recent approaches in WMSN propose in-node object detection and tracking algorithms. However, a little effort has been made to effectively 
detect object presence and absence in images in WMSN. Since, object detection has a direct relation with image transmission, therefore effective 
object detection algorithm would provide a reduction in false transmission of image information. The first part of this project demonstrated a novel 
object presence model and image transmission scheme for WMSN. This scheme uses the transmission of an image segments rather than a complete image. 
It guarantees in-node energy conservation and minimal image content transmission to the sink node. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on 
in-node energy consumption and reconstructed image Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). Simulation results show that the proposed approach saves 
95% of the node energy with the received image PSNR of 46 db as compared to other state of the art approaches.
Object localization plays a key role in many popular applications of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSN) and as a result, it has acquired
a significant status for the research community. A significant body of research performs this task without considering node orientation, 
object geometry and environmental variations. As a result, the localized object does not reflect the real world scenarios. 
The latter part of this project reported a novel object localization scheme for WMSN. It utilizes range free localization, 
computer vision, and principle component analysis based algorithms. The proposed approach provides the best possible approximation of 
distance between a WMSN sink and an object, and the orientation of the object using image based information. Simulation results report 99% 
efficiency and an error ratio of 0.01 (around 1 ft) when compared to other popular techniques.
